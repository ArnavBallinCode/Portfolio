## RagVault (Summary)
RagVault is an offline-first RAG knowledge portal built as a competition submission. It provides private, on-premise retrieval-augmented generation using FAISS, local LLMs, and hybrid retrieval.

## How to update docs
Edit files under the `docs/` directory and commit. The GitHub Pages workflow will publish the `out/` static export produced by the Next.js build.
